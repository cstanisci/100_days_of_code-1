# 100 Days Of Code

## INTRODUCTION
### About Me 
My name is Jane Nath from Portland, OR. I am graduating from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Remote program next month (February 2020) and am excited to launch into the real world as a full stack developer.

The purpose behind my 100 Days of Code is to firmly establish a habit of constant growth and learning as a developer, even after my formal coursework wraps up. I also want to populate my GitHub account with more projects, since the vast majority of my current coding work is located privately on GitHub Enterprise for General Assembly.

### General Goals 
I am gaining a strong foundation in JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS through General Assembly. I am hoping to further advance my skills in all of these technologies, with a special focus on JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and React. I also would like to try out some Angular, Vue, Python, and Java over the next 100 days to see if those are frameworks/languages that I would enjoy exploring further in the future.

### Challenge Rules/Structure
I am committing to a *minimum* of 1 hour of coding per day, **in addition** to the 30-40 hours per week I spend on my work for General Assembly, for the next 100 days (January 21, 2020 to April 30, 2020). 
This hour will start with a coding challenge (e.g. from LeetCode, Codewars, HackerRank) and then continue with online tutorials (Codecademy, freeCodeCamp.org) or working on personal projects.
I'll update this repository each day with my reflections, project links, and code snippets.

### To Do List (in progress)
* Codecademy Computer Science Career Path Course (Python, Data Structures, Command Line, Git)
* HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit
* Create an additional fullstack project for my portfolio utilizing React/Ruby on Rails/JavaScript/PostgreSQL (tbd)
* Try all Top 100 Liked Questions on LeetCode
* Review my frontend skills with Wes Bos's CSS Grid course and Codecademy's Web Development Career Path Course

## DAILY PROGRESS LOG/REFLECTIONS:

## <a name=day1>Day 1</a>: January 21, 2020
### Code Challenge: [Two Sum](https://github.com/janenath/100_days_of_code/blob/master/code_challenges/two_sum.js)
##### [Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
##### Level: EASY
To start off my 100 days, I decided to ease into coding challenges with an easy and popular challenge from LeetCode.com. One thing I want to gain from this process is a more intuitive sense of which languages will be better equipped to solve particular problems. For today, I decide to use JavaScript, since I've been deep-diving into Ruby lately with GA and wanted to mix things up. When we first started learning Ruby, we had several assignments devoted to translating solutions between JavaScript and Ruby. I might try this more often in the future as a learning exercise, especially once I gain proficiency in Python, too.

### Articles: 
##### [The Fall of The Software Engineer, The Rise of The Programmer Technician](https://medium.com/@alexkatrompas/the-fall-of-the-software-engineer-the-rise-of-the-programmer-technician-451a572d28b0)
I thought this author's historical perspective was enlightening, and his distinction between software engineers/computer scientists vs. programmers/developers was a useful one. However, I think that there is more overlap between these two paths than he suggests. As someone who has completed a direct-entry master's degree (in an entirely different field) and a soon-to-be coding bootcamp graduate, I don't expect any program, degree-granting or otherwise, to supply me with all of the information and background I need to succeed in my chosen field. At General Assembly, we are learning the fundamental computer science concepts required to achieve competency as full-stack developers, but most importantly, we are learning how to think like developers and seek out resources to constantly improve ourselves and our ability to advance the field. When I attained my master's degree in nursing and starting working as a nurse practitioner, I had been pumped full of foundational information like pharmacology and advanced pathophysiology. While this learning process was helpful to a certain extent, what ultimately was more important was that I learned how to think as a healthcare provider, how to gather and analyze complex information, and how to continually evolve and update my knowledge with evidence-based practices. I plan to approach my new career as a software engineer in the same way, even though I didn't pursue a formal degree this time around.

##### [8 VS Code Extensions that every developer should have](https://medium.com/better-programming/8-vs-code-extensions-to-help-you-write-better-code-3f3fa56a3a52)
This was a helpful list. I immediately downloaded Beautify (I had been meaning to do that for a while!), plus Code Spell Checker and Bracket Pair Colorizer, too. Bracket Pair Colorizer, in particular, is going to save me a lot of time, I think: no more tedious detective work trying to get my brackets to match up! :tada:

##### [6 Advanced Ruby Loops](https://medium.com/better-programming/6-advanced-ruby-loops-13695c20d012)
This article highlights some very useful Ruby methods! I have used most of them before (.map is particularly awesome!), but bookmarking this as a reminder of some great tools to maximize efficiency and readability in my Ruby code.
