# 100 Days Of Code
## About Me 
My name is Jane Nath from Portland, OR. I am graduating from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Remote program next month (February 2020) and am excited to launch into the real world as a full stack developer.

The purpose behind my 100 Days of Code is to firmly establish a habit of constant growth and learning as a developer, even after my formal coursework wraps up. I also want to populate my GitHub account with more projects, since the vast majority of my current coding work is located privately on GitHub Enterprise for General Assembly.

## General Goals 
I am gaining a strong foundation in JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS through General Assembly. I am hoping to further advance my skills in all of these technologies, with a special focus on JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and React. I also would like to try out some Angular, Vue, Python, and Java over the next 100 days to see if those are frameworks/languages that I would enjoy exploring further in the future.

## Challenge Rules/Structure
I am committing to a *minimum* of 1 hour of coding per day, **in addition** to the 30-40 hours per week I spend on my work for General Assembly, for the next 100 days (January 21, 2020 to April 30, 2020). 
This hour will start with a coding challenge (e.g. from LeetCode, Codewars, HackerRank) and then continue with online tutorials (Codecademy, freeCodeCamp.org) or working on personal projects.
I'll update this repository each day with my reflections, project links, and code snippets.

## To Do List (in progress)
* Codecademy Computer Science Career Path Course (Python, Data Structures, Command Line, Git)
* HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit
* Create an additional fullstack project for my portfolio utilizing React/Ruby on Rails/JavaScript/PostgreSQL (tbd)
* Try all Top 100 Liked Questions on LeetCode
* Review my frontend skills with Wes Bos's CSS Grid course and Codecademy's Web Development Career Path Course
